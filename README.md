# Calendar_TODO
 
During the development of projects, it was often necessary to copy and peek at parts of the code from past projects, so
I saved everything on the PC, and in git everything was in one repository (AllProjectForStyding), now
I sorted everything and created a separate repository

 <video controls autoplay loop preload name="media" width="300px">
                            <source src="http://localhost:5500/res/video/tourism-company.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        </video>
